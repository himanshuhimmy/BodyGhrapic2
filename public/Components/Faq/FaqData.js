    answer:
      "We DO take walk-ins and enjoy them, however it is on a first come, first serve basis. Your best bet is to call when we open at 2pm and check the availability of our artists. To guarantee a spot, we strongly recommend and encourage making an appointment.",

    question: "Can I see my drawing before the appointment?",
    answer:
      "Many times, no. Our artists are constantly drawing and creating ideas for our clients. We like to take advantage of all the time we have up until your appointment, to make sure everything is as awesome as it can be. You can check out your drawing when you come in for your appointment. Small changes can always be done on the spot, but for larger changes, the appointment may need to be rescheduled. During your consultation, we’ll get a good idea of what you’re looking for to make sure everything is on point.",
